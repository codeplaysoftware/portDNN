SYCL-DNN is a library implementing various neural network algorithms such as 
pooling and convolution written using SYCL and C++.

SYCL-DNN currently supports the following operations:

* 2D convolutions
* 2D depthwise convolutions
* 2D max & average pooling
* Relu and tanh activations

The convolution operations have several implementations, including tiled and
Winograd kernels. The supported data format is NHWC.

The project is maintained by [Codeplay Software][codeplay developer].

## Supported Platforms

The master branch of SYCL-DNN is regularly tested with the "Supported" hardware 
listed on [the ComputeCpp Supported Platforms page][supported platforms]. 
SYCL-DNN may also work on other hardware and platforms assuming they implement 
SPIR or SPIR-V support. SYCL-DNN is primarily tested on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with 
the corresponding default package versions. SYCL-DNN will generally match the 
most recently released ComputeCpp, though it is likely to be compatible with 
other versions. We test against the most recent version.

## Getting Started with SYCL-DNN

### Pre-requisites 

* CMake (version 3.5.1 and above)
* OpenCL 1.2-capable hardware and drivers with SPIR 1.2 or SPIR-V support
* OpenCL ICD Loader
* OpenCL headers
* gcc (version 5.4 and above)
* [ComputeCpp][codeplay developer]
* Building documentation requires Doxygen and Graphviz/Dot. Tested
  against versions 1.8.11 and 2.38.0 respectively.

### Building SYCL-DNN

SYCL-DNN uses CMake as its build system. There are provisions in the CMake
files for downloading SYCL-DNN's dependencies automatically, for finding
other dependencies and for selecting which bits of SYCL-DNN to build. All
these configuration options can be found in the main CMakeLists.txt for the
project and will show up in the CMake GUI if you use it. By default, the
tests and library will be built, but not the benchmarks.

It is recommended to leave the option `SNN_DOWNLOAD_MISSING_DEPS` set to
on. This will automatically download the source libraries necessary for
SYCL-DNN to build and run (such as Google Test, Google benchmark and
the Eigen linear algebra library). Even if you already have these on your
machine, downloading them as part of the SYCL-DNN means a more consistent
configuration.

You will need to provide the location of the ComputeCpp install you are
using in the variable `ComputeCpp_DIR`. It should point to the folder
where `bin/`, `lib/` etc. are. This should be the only argument that is
mandatory, everything else should be optional. The default build type is
Release, though this can be overridden.

The following command shows how to compile SYCL-DNN.

```bash
# Setup build environment
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DComputeCpp_DIR=/path/to/computecpp
# Compile SYCL-DNN
make -j`nproc`
```

### Sample Code

The "samples" directory contains sample code for the 2D convolution and pooling 
operations offered by SYCL-DNN. These binaries are compiled when building SYCL-DNN 
using CMake.

### Running the SYCL-DNN Tests

The SYCL-DNN tests are compiled when building SYCL-DNN using CMake.
The following command shows how to run the tests.

```bash
# Run the tests
ctest
# If compiled with benchmark support, run just the benchmarks
ctest -C Benchmark -E test
```

### Bug reports and Issues

Bug reports are vital to provide feedback to the developers about what is going
wrong with the project, you can raise these using the ["Issues"][issues] 
feature in GitHub.

Please make sure that your bug report contains the following information:

* A clear and descriptive title.
* The output of
  `clinfo | grep -E "Platform ID|Name|Vendor|[Vv]ersion|Profile|Extensions"`.
* The output of `computecpp_info`.
* The exact steps and commands to run to reproduce the bug.
* The exact error text shown (if applicable), otherwise the behaviour you
  expected and what you encountered instead.
* Should the problem arise outside the project's test suite then please provide
  a minimal test to allow us to reproduce the problem.

## Cross-compilation with ComputeCpp

SYCL-DNN supports cross-compilation targeting a number of devices. However,
because of the two-step compilation process used in ComputeCpp, standard
CMake toolchain files won't provide enough information to SYCL-DNN's build
scripts to work properly.

To that end, two toolchains are available. The first, gcc-generic.cmake,
will likely work with any prebuilt GCC toolchain (it is not compatible
with those installed through package managers). The second is designed to
work with the poky toolchain available as part of the Yocto Linux system.

The first step is to download ComputeCpp for both the host machine you are
running on and for the platform you would like to target. You should make
sure to match the ComputeCpp version for both downloads. Both are required
so that the host can run the compiler binary, while the tools can link
using the target device library. Similarly, acquire a GCC toolchain for
the platform you are targeting. Lastly you should download the OpenCL
headers. They are standard across all platforms, but you cannot specify
the default package-managed location of `/usr/include` for them, as that
will cause conflicts with other system headers. An easy fix is to download
the headers [from GitHub][ocl headers].

Toolchain files cannot make use cache variables set by the user when
running CMake, as the cache does not exist when the toolchain is executed.
Environment variables are available to toolchain files, however, so they
are used to pass information to the toolchain. The gcc-generic.cmake
toolchain relies on the following environment variables:

```cmake
SNN_TARGET_TRIPLE # the triple of the platform you are targeting
SNN_TOOLCHAIN_DIR # The root directory of the GCC you downloaded
SNN_SYSROOT_DIR   # The system root, probably (but not necessarily)
                  # ${SNN_TOOLCHAIN_DIR}/${SNN_TARGET_TRIPLE}/libc
```

CMake can then be invoked in a build directory as follows:

```bash
cmake -DComputeCpp_DIR=/path/to/computecpp \
      -DComputeCpp_HOST_DIR=/path/to/host/computecpp \
      -DOpenCL_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/opencl/headers \
      `# For cross-compiling, check documentation for your platform` \
      -DCOMPUTECPP_BITCODE=[(spir[32|64]|spirv[32|64]|ptx64)] \
      -DSNN_BUILD_DOCUMENTATION=OFF \
      `# Next options let you install the tests to a zippable folder` \
      -DSNN_BUILD_TESTS=ON \
      -DSNN_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=ON \
      -DSNN_INSTALL_TESTS=ON \
      -DSNN_INSTALL_BENCHMARKS=ON \
      `# This is the most important part - tells CMake to crosscompile` \
      -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=$PWD/../cmake/toolchains/(gcc-generic|arm-gcc-poky).cmake \
      -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=packaged-binaries \
      -GNinja ../
```

The process for the poky toolchain is similar, save that you only need to
provide the `SNN_SYSROOT_DIR` environment variable. It should be set to
point to the directory named `sysroots` in the poky toolchain. You will
likely want `COMPUTECPP_BITCODE=spir32`. Otherwise, these instructions
should still work.
